Take a look: https://gleis161.ch.

A static page built with <a href="https://astro.build/">Astro.js</a>. The foundation was built after some research and scouring of web archives , looking at the SBB and ZVV web presences from the 90s and early 2000s as well as their physical tickets. Furthermore, the design work of several anonymous contributors is present in the site, in the form of a litle mini game encouraging users to click.

Due to fear of repression, the site was built with a central encrypted content management system for anonymous administration, allowing all content to be changed without any personalized account, using the TOR network and exchanging of secrets.

The aim of the project was to raise money for organizations in Gaza. Find the source <a href="https://github.com/gleis161/home">here</a>.
