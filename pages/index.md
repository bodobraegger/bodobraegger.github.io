Hi, I am Bodo Braegger, and I make hard- and software for art and research. I am currently studying [Transdisciplinary Arts](https://www.zhdk.ch/en/degree-programmes/transdisciplinarystudies) at [ZHdK](https://www.zhdk.ch/en), and work at the [Decision Science Laboratory](https://descil.ethz.ch/) of [ETH ZÃ¼rich](https://ethz.ch/) - the research university where I studied Computer Science.<br>

This page will hold portfolio and curriculum vitae fragments, notes and an archive of projects I have worked on.
<!-- 
I <3 creating, and software engineering has proven to be a very flexible medium. I was able to explore and realize numerous ideas. You can find a [selection of my projects here](/projects). I also do generative art, interactivity experiments, and live-coding performances. Resources for these can be found [here](/projects#generative-art-and-live-coding-resources).
