Hi, I am Bodo Braegger, and I make software. Right now, I work at the [Decision Science Laboratory](https://descil.ethz.ch/) of [ETH Zürich](https://ethz.ch/) - the research university where I studied Computer Science.<br>

I am passionate about creating, and software engineering has proven to be a very flexible medium that allows me to explore and realize numerous ideas. You can find my [project list here](/projects). I also do some generative art, interactivity experiments, and live-coding performances. Resources for these can be found [here](/projects#generative-art-and-live-coding-resources).

<!-- Outside of programming, I enjoy making music, painting, and playing with my cat. -->
