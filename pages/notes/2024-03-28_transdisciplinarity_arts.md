## Inspirations

### Contemporary Art
- Hito Steyerl's work (such as [SocialSim Exhibition](https://www.locarnofestival.ch/locarno75/locarno-extra/exhibition-hito-steyerl.html)), in relation to my experience working in research in social sciences.
- Xu Bing's [Dragonfly Eyes](https://www.moma.org/calendar/film/5009), here the [Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0fedg-Skns), and here a [full stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Iz-t_zsQM).
- Cickindunt (Vitalii Cherepanov & Anna Cherepanova)'s [CCTV movies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyLoMbDl8fM), and their use and manipulation of public space.

### Tools, Hard- and Software, Interactivity Experiments
- Linus Zimmermann's explorations of analogue and digital synthesizers in expertly crafted enclosures.
- Olivia Jack's open source [hydra](https://hydra.ojack.xyz), a live coding video synth - the technical feat of making something as complex as shaders and making it accessible to people with minimal equipment, and a willingness to experiment or experience with synthesizers.
- QuiltScapes @ [In:dépendance](https://www.e-flux.com/announcements/515904/in-dpendance-2023/) 2023 of ETH Zürich.

### Curated Content, Internet Art and Archives 
- The [webring](https://webring.xxiivv.com/), a place to interconnect portfolios and web archives and share internet traffic. 
- Axelle Stiefel's [Artist Network Theory](https://beta.vorstellen.network/96dd87fb-f2a8-494f-9dba-48d67389b123), and the [vorstellen.network](https://beta.vorstellen.network/dd757dcc-d5f4-4e10-a788-2dfb5f34a994).
