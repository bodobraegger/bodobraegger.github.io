## Dossier and Project Outline

### Dossier of Recordings

Please find a few recorded works [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/p5vygqgq5qsfwwpfh2pqj/ACA2BkjYRDzF8yofAAANC6c?rlkey=1tm91vg4653v364ahislfbo6j&st=23qycqhj&dl=0).

My previous production practice was mostly informed by certain conceptual contraints. In the uploaded files, I generally wanted to use as much sound material from an existing source. 

I have been producing music since around 2012, where I started as a teenager with Cubase. I have moved across DAWs, from Sampling and producing hip hop, to more experimental electronic music, modular synthesizers, live-coding and live performances. Of later works I have very few recordings, so the works in the link above are mostly archival.

The [`super cut review.wav`](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/p5vygqgq5qsfwwpfh2pqj/APhJzH4pcsOPAOXRove46EA/super%20cut%20review.wav?rlkey=1tm91vg4653v364ahislfbo6j&e=1&dl=0) and the [`departure.wav`](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/l0f3na3blw4aozvmt8t5o/departure.wav?rlkey=686yfg20vqaf1fchi45empm0g&e=1&st=3esa0psm&dl=0) files consist entirely of samples of documentary films; I created a short EP where the super cut contains snippets of all tracks therein.

Then, the [`mountains_septims_b.wav`](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/p5vygqgq5qsfwwpfh2pqj/AAolBpfRsA-fjA_fjkSsBpw/mountains_septims_b.wav?rlkey=1tm91vg4653v364ahislfbo6j&e=1&dl=0) track is composed of samples of a high security door rattling and it's buzzer blaring, as well as a video game soundtrack.

Finally, [`untitled_bottle_b.wav`](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/p5vygqgq5qsfwwpfh2pqj/ALrbNZS13hDVScVr_2tZxZQ/untitled_bottle_b.wav?rlkey=1tm91vg4653v364ahislfbo6j&e=1&dl=0) is composed of two tracks, an intricate Diva patch and a midi score of a recording of a friend of mine blowing into a bottle.

My previous minor at ZHdK was _Storytelling with Sound Design_, where I was able to again brush up on recording techniques when working with artists in a more professional context.


### Project Outline

Lately, I have been very inspired by artists such as [_Toxe_](https://www.toxe2.com/) and [_Fever Ray_](https://feverray.com/). I have also started DJing, and not just producing music, which has opened me up to a large array of new influences and new directions. 

Whilst I can't really situate my previous production into Pop (or Jazz) as a genre, my newfound influences definitely point me in that direction and I would love to explore this further. 

I am familiar with the technical side of audio production, and would love the possiblity to collaborate with musicians who are also looking into more experimental electronic pop. 

I don't have a concrete project idea, but would love to spend more time to focus on bringing in my different musical interests and produce a sketch for an album or collection of tracks that ties in my previous forays in sampling and my passion for synthesizers and electronic, in a collaborative frame. A possible outcome could also be a sketch for a score for a short film, already existing, or simply trying to capture a range of emotions and paces.

Thank you for your consideration.
