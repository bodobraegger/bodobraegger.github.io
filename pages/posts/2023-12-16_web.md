> This website been sitting in my drafts for too long now, so I decided to squash all commits and publish it as-is.

I have been working on this website for a while now, and I am finally publishing it.
Here I will host an overview of my projects, events, and performances I am a part of, and also miscellaneous notes like these. At some point, I might reorganize this into different categories or even some sort of blog.

I will also use this as a playground for experimenting with new web technologies and ideas.
