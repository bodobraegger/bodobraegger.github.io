They are often packed with interactivity, animations, and other features. Hardware has been steadily improving, which fueled the development of more complex websites, user interfaces, and software in general.\n\nAnything a developer might dream up is already legitimized to be implemented, but I strongly believe in making software as fast as possible.\n\n\nEspecially the web serves as a platform for interaction. A fast, responsive website is crucial for a positive user experience. Slow websites can be frustrating (and lead to high bounce rates and lost revenue). \n\nThis article discusses four modern techniques - Preload, Prefetch, Preconnect, and DNS Prefetch - to optimize website speed. I intend to apply these techniques to the website you are currently visiting.\n\nEssentially, these techniques allow resources to be loaded without blocking the main page load process (the document\'s `onload` event). The decision of when the optimal time to load a resource is deferred to the browser. This is based on the resource\'s priority and the user\'s network conditions.\n\n## Preload\n\nPreload reduces page load time by preloading critical resources like CSS, JavaScript, and images. When a user visits your website, these resources are already in their browser cache. To use preload, add the following link tag to your HTML code:\n\n```js\n// Preloading a resource\n<link rel="preload" href="your-resource-here" as="resource-type">\n```\nThe `href` attribute specifies the resource URL and the `as` attribute specifies the resource type. For example, to preload a CSS file or an image:\n\n```js\n// Preloading a CSS file and an image\n<link rel="preload" href="styles.css" as="style">\n<link rel="preload" href="image.jpg" as="image">\n```\n\nThis makes sense for resources any website needs, such as CSS, JavaScript, and images. However, it\'s not recommended for resources that are only needed on specific pages. For example, if you have a large image on a page that is rarely visited, preloading it would be a waste of resources.\n\n## Prefetch\n\nPrefetch loads resources needed on subsequent pages, similar to Preload but for future needs. For example, prefetch an image on a linked page to load it faster when the user clicks the link. To use prefetch, add the following link tag:\n\n```js\n// Prefetching a resource\n<link rel="prefetch" href="your-resource-here">\n```\nThe `href` attribute specifies the resource URL. For example, to prefetch an image:\n\n```js\n// Prefetching an image\n<link rel="prefetch" href="image.jpg">\n```\n\nThis can make switching between pages feel significantly faster. \n\n## Preconnect\n\nPreconnect establishes a server connection before resource requests, reducing latency. To use preconnect, add the following link tag:\n\n```js\n// Preconnecting to a server\n<link rel="preconnect" href="your-server-here">\n```\nThe `href` attribute specifies the server URL. For example, to preconnect to a server or cdn hosting your CSS file:\n\n```js\n// Preconnecting to a server hosting a CSS file or images\n<link rel="preconnect" href="https://your-resources-host-here">\n```\n\n## DNS Prefetch\n\nDNS Prefetch resolves the domain name of a resource before it\'s requested, reducing DNS resolution time. To use DNS Prefetch, add the following link tag. The `href` attribute specifies the domain name. For example, to prefetch the domain name of a CDN:\n\n\n```js\n// DNS Prefetching domain name\n<link rel="dns-prefetch" href="https://your-cdn.com">\n```\nBy prefetching the domain name, the browser can resolve the server\'s IP address in advance. This is useful for servers that host required resources (such as images), as it reduces the latency of subsequent requests.\n\n### Preconnect vs DNS Prefetch\n\nPreconnect and DNS Prefetch differ in purpose and scope. Preconnect establishes an early connection to a server and downloads critical resources, while DNS Prefetch resolves the domain name of a server in advance. Preconnect is used for critical resources needed early in the page load process, while DNS Prefetch is typically used for resources needed later.\n\n## Advantages and Disadvantages\n\n### Advantages\n\n* **Improved website performance**: Preload, prefetch, preconnect, and DNS prefetch can reduce latency and optimize resource loading.\n* **Better user experience**: Faster load times can enhance user experience, as visitors are more likely to stay on a fast-loading website.\n* **Increased engagement**: A responsive website can increase visitor interaction.\n* **Improved SEO**: Faster websites can improve search engine rankings, as website speed is a factor in search results for most search engines.\n\n### Disadvantages\n\nDespite their benefits, these methods have potential downsides.\n\n* **Increased network bandwidth**: These techniques can increase (user) network bandwidth consumption, as resources are downloaded and cached in advance.\n* **Increased server load**: Server load can increase, as resources are requested and cached in advance.\n* **Risk of cache pollution**: Preloading and prefetching unnecessary resources can lead to cache pollution, reducing these techniques\' effectiveness.\n* **Implementation complexity**: Implementing these techniques requires technical knowledge and can be complex for large or complex websites.\n\n## Tips and Tricks\n\nA few bits of advice for using these techniques - as collected from research and experience.\n\n* **Use techniques sparingly**: While these techniques can improve website performance, excessive use can have the opposite effect. Only preload, prefetch, and preconnect resources that are critical or likely to be needed soon.\n* **Prioritize above-the-fold content**: Improve perceived performance by preloading and prefetching resources needed for above-the-fold content, the part of the page visible without scrolling.\n* **Optimize images**: Reduce image file size to improve load times. Use image compression tools or the appropriate image format (e.g., JPEG for photos, PNG / SVG for graphics).\n* **Implement caching**: Reduce requests and improve load times with caching. Use HTTP caching headers (e.g., cache-control, expires) to specify how long resources should be cached.\n* **Use a reliable hosting provider**: A fast and reliable hosting provider can improve page load time. Choose a host that suits your needs. This page is still hosted on GitHub Pages, as it is a static website and is supposed to remain relatively simple. I might switch to a different host in the future.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOptimal website speed is crucial to allow for the UX to effectively center around the website\'s content - and not be muddled with frustation on waiting. Techniques like Preload, Prefetch, Preconnect, and DNS Prefetch can reduce latency and manage resources for faster load times. \n\nImplementing these methods enhances your website\'s performance, but use them appropriately to avoid excess resource consumption and potential device overload.\n'},Symbol.toStringTag,{value:"Module"})),w=Object.freeze(Object.defineProperty({__proto__:null,default:"---\ntitle: Livecoding Documentation\nplace: Zürich, Switzerland\ndate: 2024-02-27T16:00:00.000+01:00\nlang: en\ntype: note+blog\nhydra: true\nplum: true\n---\n\nHere are code examples of visual programs that were created in different contexts. They are written in JavaScript, with a framework called hydra. It mimics analogue video synthesis modules, which can be freely patched together. They should automatically run when you scroll past them, but if they don't, you can click on it to (re-)start it.\n\nThe example code below creates a gradient and periodically pixelates it. If it does not display, your browser might not support the hydra environment. For each snippet, there is an outgoing link with the containing snippet in the the official hydra editor. You can follow these links to change the code and the parameters, and see how the generated images change.\n\n```javascript\ngradient(1).pixelate([width, 20], [height, 20]).out(o0)\n```\n\nThe snippet below was created on the 10.

Whenever you reload this page, the newest image of the video feed will appear below. There is a small timestamp on the top left of the image to confirm this. And in general, if you are looking at this from a region with a time similar to the Central European Standard Time (UTC+1), the lighting should match your time of day.\n\n![Video feed: Airport Stuttgart](https://wsrv.nl/?url=http://94.124.210.59:8083/jpg/1/image.jpg)\n\nBelow is a simplified approximation of what such a visualization might look.

This is a phrase that I have heard in the context of live coding, and it is a good summary of the practice. \n\nIt is not trivial to document this in a static, written form. Even with the help of these visualization examples, the actual experience of live coding and reactivity is not captured. This is a limitation of the medium, and it is a challenge to find ways to communicate the experience of live coding to a wider audience. I will try to periodically update this page with new examples and ideas, and references to other resources. \n\nThe rest of this page will be filled with patterns I created for performances, installations and experiments.

the technical feat of making something as complex as shaders and making it accessible to people with minimal equipment, and a willingness to experiment or experience with synthesizers.\n- QuiltScapes @ [In:dépendance](https://www.e-flux.com/announcements/515904/in-dpendance-2023/) 2023 of ETH Zürich.\n\n### Internet Art, Curated Content, and Archival Work\n- The [webring](https://webring.xxiivv.com/), a place to interconnect portfolios and web archives and share internet traffic. \n- Axelle Stiefel's [Artist Network Theory](https://beta.vorstellen.network/96dd87fb-f2a8-494f-9dba-48d67389b123), and the [vorstellen.network](https://beta.vorstellen.network/dd757dcc-d5f4-4e10-a788-2dfb5f34a994).\n"},Symbol.toStringTag,{value:"Module"})),b=Object.freeze(Object.defineProperty({__proto__:null,default:'---\ntitle: photos\ndate: 2024-04-17\nlang: en\ntype: note+blog\nhydra: false\ndraft: true\n---\n\n\n<img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GK0Ab89WIAAsA8V?format=jpg&name=medium" alt="1" id="1">\n<img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GK0Ab9EXQAAT-pM?format=jpg&name=medium" alt="2" id="2">\n<img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GK0Ab87XoAA-Lqn?format=jpg&name=medium" alt="3" id="3">\n<img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GK0Ab9EXMAIlLXi?format=jpg&name=medium" alt="4" id="4">\n\n![5](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GLFNyqFXoAQKK5K?format=jpg&name=medium)\n'},Symbol.toStringTag,{value:"Module"})),k=Object.freeze(Object.defineProperty({__proto__:null,default:"---\ntitle: picture examples for maxi\ndate: 2024-04-24\nlang: en\ntype: note+blog\nhydra: false\ndraft: true\n---\n\x3c!-- @layout-full-width --\x3e\n\nhello maxi!\n<div>\n<list-images />\n</div>"},Symbol.toStringTag,{value:"Module"})),S=Object.freeze(Object.defineProperty({__proto__:null,default:"---\ntitle: Chess Poetry by Tina\ndate: 2024-04-25\nlang: en\ntype: note+blog\nhydra: false\ndraft: true\n---\n\n<div font-mono font-size-1.69ch line-height-2.1ch dark:hue-rotate-90>\n1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234\n1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234\n1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234\n1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234\n1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234\n1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234\n1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234\n1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234\n1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234\n1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234\n1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234\n1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234\n1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234\n1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234\n1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234\n1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234\n1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234\n1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234\n1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234\n1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234\n1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234\n1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234\n1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234\n1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234\n1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234\n1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234\n1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234\n1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234\n1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234\n1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234\n1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234\n1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234\n</div>\n\n<style scoped>\n    div {\n        min-height: 70ch;\n        object-fit: cover;\n        background: repeating-conic-gradient(#000 0% 25%, transparent 0% 50%) 50% / 25% 25%;\n    }\n    html.dark div {\n        background: repeating-conic-gradient(#FFF 0% 25%, transparent 0% 50%) 50% / 25% 25%;\n    }\n</style>\n"},Symbol.toStringTag,{value:"Module"})),x=Object.freeze(Object.defineProperty({__proto__:null,default:'---\ntitle: Hydra Livecode Examples\nplace: Zürich, Switzerland\ndate: 2025-04-26T14:29:00.000+01:00\nlang: en\ntype: note+blog\nhydra: true\nplum: true\n---\n\nHere are some examples of Hydra sketches that I have created or modified.

[here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/p5vygqgq5qsfwwpfh2pqj/ACA2BkjYRDzF8yofAAANC6c?rlkey=1tm91vg4653v364ahislfbo6j&st=23qycqhj&dl=0).\n\nMy previous production practice was mostly informed by certain conceptual contraints. In the uploaded files, I generally wanted to use as much sound material from an existing source. \n\nI have been producing music since around 2012, where I started as a teenager with Cubase. I have moved across DAWs, from Sampling and producing hip hop, to more experimental electronic music, modular synthesizers, live-coding and live performances. Of later works I have very few recordings, so the works in the link above are mostly archival.\n\nThe [`super cut review.wav`](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/p5vygqgq5qsfwwpfh2pqj/APhJzH4pcsOPAOXRove46EA/super%20cut%20review.wav?rlkey=1tm91vg4653v364ahislfbo6j&e=1&dl=0) and the [`departure.wav`](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/l0f3na3blw4aozvmt8t5o/departure.wav?rlkey=686yfg20vqaf1fchi45empm0g&e=1&st=3esa0psm&dl=0) files consist entirely of samples of documentary films; I created a short EP where the super cut contains snippets of all tracks therein.\n\nThen, the [`mountains_septims_b.wav`](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/p5vygqgq5qsfwwpfh2pqj/AAolBpfRsA-fjA_fjkSsBpw/mountains_septims_b.wav?rlkey=1tm91vg4653v364ahislfbo6j&e=1&dl=0) track is composed of samples of a high security door rattling and it's buzzer blaring, as well as a video game soundtrack.\n\nFinally, [`untitled_bottle_b.wav`](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/p5vygqgq5qsfwwpfh2pqj/ALrbNZS13hDVScVr_2tZxZQ/untitled_bottle_b.wav?rlkey=1tm91vg4653v364ahislfbo6j&e=1&dl=0) is composed of two tracks, an intricate Diva patch and a midi score of a recording of a friend of mine blowing into a bottle.\n\nMy previous minor at ZHdK was _Storytelling with Sound Design_, where I was able to again brush up on recording techniques when working with artists in a more professional context.\n\n\n### Project Outline\n\nLately, I have been very inspired by artists such as [_Toxe_](https://www.toxe2.com/) and [_Fever Ray_](https://feverray.com/). I have also started DJing, and not just producing music, which has opened me up to a large array of new influences and new directions. \n\nWhilst I can't really situate my previous production into Pop (or Jazz) as a genre, my newfound influences definitely point me in that direction and I would love to explore this further. \n\nI am familiar with the technical side of audio production, and would love the possiblity to collaborate with musicians who are also looking into more experimental electronic pop. \n\nI don't have a concrete project idea, but would love to spend more time to focus on bringing in my different musical interests and produce a sketch for an album or collection of tracks that ties in my previous forays in sampling and my passion for synthesizers and electronic, in a collaborative frame. A possible outcome could also be a sketch for a score for a short film, already existing, or simply trying to capture a range of emotions and paces.\n\nThank you for your consideration.\n"},Symbol.toStringTag,{value:"Module"})),T=Object.freeze(Object.defineProperty({__proto__:null,default:"---\ntitle: Transcultural Collaboration\nplace: Zürich, Switzerland\ndate: 2025-05-10T14:29:00.000+01:00\nlang: en\ntype: note+blog\nhydra: true\nplum: true\ndraft: true\n---\n\nWIP: Please check back later.\n\n```javascript\nnoise(1).modulate(noise(2)).out()\n```\n"},Symbol.toStringTag,{value:"Module"})),_=Object.freeze(Object.defineProperty({__proto__:null,default:"---\ntitle: B - Notes\nplum: true\ndisplay: ''\n---\n\n\x3c!-- <SubNav /> --\x3e\n\n<ListPosts only-date type=\"note\" />\n"},Symbol.toStringTag,{value:"Module"})),U=Object.freeze(Object.defineProperty({__proto__:null,default:'---\ntitle: AI Agent Design Guidelines Input\nplace: Zürich, Switzerland\ndate: 2025-10-14T14:29:00.000+01:00\nlang: en\ntype: note+blog\nplum: true\ndraft: true\n---\n\nConcise rules for building accessible, fast, delightful UIs Use MUST/SHOULD/NEVER to guide decisions\n\n````md\n## Interactions\n\n- Keyboard\n  - MUST: Full keyboard support per [WAI-ARIA APG](https://wwww3org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/)\n  - MUST: Visible focus rings (`:focus-visible`; group with `:focus-within`)\n  - MUST: Manage focus (trap, move, and return) per APG patterns\n- Targets & input\n  - MUST: Hit target ≥24px (mobile ≥44px) If visual <24px, expand hit area\n  - MUST: Mobile `<input>` font-size ≥16px or set:\n    ```html\n    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, viewport-fit=cover">\n    ```\n  - NEVER: Disable browser zoom\n  - MUST: `touch-action: manipulation` to prevent double-tap zoom; set `-webkit-tap-highlight-color` to match design\n- Inputs & forms (behavior)\n  - MUST: Hydration-safe inputs (no lost focus/value)\n  - NEVER: Block paste in `<input>/<textarea>`\n  - MUST: Loading buttons show spinner and keep original label\n  - MUST: Enter submits focused text input In `<textarea>`, ⌘/Ctrl+Enter submits; Enter adds newline\n  - MUST: Keep submit enabled until request starts; then disable, show spinner, use idempotency key\n  - MUST: Don’t block typing; accept free text and validate after\n  - MUST: Allow submitting incomplete forms to surface validation\n  - MUST: Errors inline next to fields; on submit, focus first error\n  - MUST: `autocomplete` + meaningful `name`; correct `type` and `inputmode`\n  - SHOULD: Disable spellcheck for emails/codes/usernames\n  - SHOULD: Placeholders end with ellipsis and show example pattern (eg, `+1 (123) 456-7890`, `sk-012345…`)\n  - MUST: Warn on unsaved changes before navigation\n  - MUST: Compatible with password managers & 2FA; allow pasting one-time codes\n  - MUST: Trim values to handle text expansion trailing spaces\n  - MUST: No dead zones on checkboxes/radios; label+control share one generous hit target\n- State & navigation\n  - MUST: URL reflects state (deep-link filters/tabs/pagination/expanded panels) Prefer libs like [nuqs](https://nuqs.dev)\n  - MUST: Back/Forward restores scroll\n  - MUST: Links are links—use `<a>/<Link>` for navigation (support Cmd/Ctrl/middle-click)\n- Feedback\n  - SHOULD: Optimistic UI; reconcile on response; on failure show error and rollback or offer Undo\n  - MUST: Confirm destructive actions or provide Undo window\n  - MUST: Use polite `aria-live` for toasts/inline validation\n  - SHOULD: Ellipsis (`…`) for options that open follow-ups (eg, “Rename…”)\n- Touch/drag/scroll\n  - MUST: Design forgiving interactions (generous targets, clear affordances; avoid finickiness)\n  - MUST: Delay first tooltip in a group; subsequent peers no delay\n  - MUST: Intentional `overscroll-behavior: contain` in modals/drawers\n  - MUST: During drag, disable text selection and set `inert` on dragged element/containers\n  - MUST: No “dead-looking” interactive zones—if it looks clickable, it is\n- Autofocus\n  - SHOULD: Autofocus on desktop when there’s a single primary input; rarely on mobile (to avoid layout shift)\n\n## Animation\n\n- MUST: Honor `prefers-reduced-motion` (provide reduced variant)\n- SHOULD: Prefer CSS > Web Animations API > JS libraries\n- MUST: Animate compositor-friendly props (`transform`, `opacity`); avoid layout/repaint props (`top/left/width/height`)\n- SHOULD: Animate only to clarify cause/effect or add deliberate delight\n- SHOULD: Choose easing to match the change (size/distance/trigger)\n- MUST: Animations are interruptible and input-driven (avoid autoplay)\n- MUST: Correct `transform-origin` (motion starts where it “physically” should)\n\n## Layout\n\n- SHOULD: Optical alignment; adjust by ±1px when perception beats geometry\n- MUST: Deliberate alignment to grid/baseline/edges/optical centers—no accidental placement\n- SHOULD: Balance icon/text lockups (stroke/weight/size/spacing/color)\n- MUST: Verify mobile, laptop, ultra-wide (simulate ultra-wide at 50% zoom)\n- MUST: Respect safe areas (use env(safe-area-inset-\\*))\n- MUST: Avoid unwanted scrollbars; fix overflows\n\n## Content & Accessibility\n\n- SHOULD: Inline help first; tooltips last resort\n- MUST: Skeletons mirror final content to avoid layout shift\n- MUST: `<title>` matches current context\n- MUST: No dead ends; always offer next step/recovery\n- MUST: Design empty/sparse/dense/error states\n- SHOULD: Curly quotes (“ ”); avoid widows/orphans\n- MUST: Tabular numbers for comparisons (`font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` or a mono like Geist Mono)\n- MUST: Redundant status cues (not color-only); icons have text labels\n- MUST: Don’t ship the schema—visuals may omit labels but accessible names still exist\n- MUST: Use the ellipsis character `…` (not ``)\n- MUST: `scroll-margin-top` on headings for anchored links; include a “Skip to content” link; hierarchical `<h1–h6>`\n- MUST: Resilient to user-generated content (short/avg/very long)\n- MUST: Locale-aware dates/times/numbers/currency\n- MUST: Accurate names (`aria-label`), decorative elements `aria-hidden`, verify in the Accessibility Tree\n- MUST: Icon-only buttons have descriptive `aria-label`\n- MUST: Prefer native semantics (`button`, `a`, `label`, `table`) before ARIA\n- SHOULD: Right-clicking the nav logo surfaces brand assets\n- MUST: Use non-breaking spaces to glue terms: `10&nbsp;MB`, `⌘&nbsp;+&nbsp;K`, `Vercel&nbsp;SDK`\n\n## Performance\n\n- SHOULD: Test iOS Low Power Mode and macOS Safari\n- MUST: Measure reliably (disable extensions that skew runtime)\n- MUST: Track and minimize re-renders (React DevTools/React Scan)\n- MUST: Profile with CPU/network throttling\n- MUST: Batch layout reads/writes; avoid unnecessary reflows/repaints\n- MUST: Mutations (`POST/PATCH/DELETE`) target <500 ms\n- SHOULD: Prefer uncontrolled inputs; make controlled loops cheap (keystroke cost)\n- MUST: Virtualize large lists (eg, `virtua`)\n- MUST: Preload only above-the-fold images; lazy-load the rest\n- MUST: Prevent CLS from images (explicit dimensions or reserved space)\n\n## Design\n\n- SHOULD: Layered shadows (ambient + direct)\n- SHOULD: Crisp edges via semi-transparent borders + shadows\n- SHOULD: Nested radii: child ≤ parent; concentric\n- SHOULD: Hue consistency: tint borders/shadows/text toward bg hue\n- MUST: Accessible charts (color-blind-friendly palettes)\n- MUST: Meet contrast—prefer [APCA](https://apcacontrastcom/) over WCAG 2\n- MUST: Increase contrast on `:hover/:active/:focus`\n- SHOULD: Match browser UI to bg\n- SHOULD: Avoid gradient banding (use masks when needed)\n\n```\n\n```\n````\n'},Symbol.toStringTag,{value:"Module"})),j=Object.freeze(Object.defineProperty({__proto__:null,default:"---\ntitle: File Listing\n---\n\n<ListFiles />\n"},Symbol.toStringTag,{value:"Module"})),P={class:"font-mono text-sm"},A=e({__name:"ListFiles",props:{folder:{}},setup(e){const m=e,p=n().path.split("/").filter(Boolean).slice(-1)[0]||"",u=m.folder||p,f=Object.assign({"../../pages/notes/2023-12-16_web.md":g,"../../pages/notes/2024-01-17_front_end_optimization.md":y,"../../pages/notes/2024-02-27_livecoding_docs.md":w,"../../pages/notes/2024-03-27_transdisciplinarity_arts.md":v,"../../pages/notes/2024-04-14_photography.md":b,"../../pages/notes/2024-04-24_images.md":k,"../../pages/notes/2024-04-25_chess.md":S,"../../pages/notes/2025-04-26_livecoding_examples.md":x,"../../pages/notes/2025-05-08_producing_composing_advanced.md":M,"../../pages/notes/2025-05-08_transcultural_collaboration.md":T,"../../pages/notes/index.md":_,"../../pages/notes/misc/AGENTS.md":U,"../../pages/notes/misc/index.md":j}),A=Object.keys(f).filter(e=>e.includes(`/notes/${u}/`)&&!e.includes("index.md")).filter(e=>"index.md"!==(e.split("/").pop()||"")).map(e=>({name:e.split("/").pop()||""}));return(e,n)=>{const m=t("RouterLink");return o(),a("div",P,[(o(!0),a(i,null,s(r(A),e=>(o(),a("div",{key:e.name},[l(m,{to:`${r(u)}/${e.name.replace(".md","")}`},{default:c(()=>[d(h(e.name),1)]),_:2},1032,["to"])]))),128))])}}}),I={class:"prose m-auto"},z={__name:"index",setup(e){const n={title:"File Listing",meta:[{property:"og:title",content:"File Listing"},{name:"twitter:title",content:"File Listing"}]};return m({title:"File Listing",meta:[{property:"og:title",content:"File Listing"},{name:"twitter:title",content:"File Listing"}]}),(e,t)=>{const a=A,i=u;return o(),p(i,{frontmatter:n},{default:c(()=>[f("div",I,[l(a)])]),_:1})}}};export{z as default};
